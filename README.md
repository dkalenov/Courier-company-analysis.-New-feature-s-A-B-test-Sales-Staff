# Logistic Company Hypothesis Testing

## Project Objectives

Conduct hypothesis testing on logistics company data to derive insights and make data-driven decisions.

## Tasks

1. **Delivery Time A/B Test Analysis**
   - Analyze delivery time data from an A/B test.
   - Test the hypothesis that the new app feature reduces delivery time.

2. **Customer Order Discount Analysis**
   - Analyze customer order data before and after the introduction of a discount.
   - Test the hypothesis that customers place more orders after the discount.

3. **Courier Education and Experience Analysis**
   - Analyze courier data to understand the relationship between education and work experience.
   - Test the hypothesis that work experience depends on the level of education.

4. **Confidence Intervals Construction**
   - Construct 95% confidence intervals for average delivery times using and not using the new multimodal option in the app.

## Conclusion

The conclusions of each task will provide valuable insights for the logistics company to make informed decisions.
